## Step 2: Requirement Analysis

Users: Admin, Staff, and Student.      
Main Functions: Student registration, course enrollment, fee payment, record updating, and report generation.    
Non-Functional Needs: Security, reliability, and an easy-to-use interface.

## Step 3: System Design

Draw UML diagrams: Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, Communication, and Package diagrams.    
Design database tables for Students, Courses, Enrollment, and Fees.
